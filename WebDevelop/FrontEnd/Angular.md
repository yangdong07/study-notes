### Library vs. Framework

参考 <https://medium.com/datafire-io/libraries-vs-frameworks-626cdde799a7> 写的很不错。

> In general, the differentiating feature is a matter of control — frameworks dictate how your project will be structured, whereas libraries are building blocks that can be used anywhere. If we use the metaphor of architecture, libraries are bricks, and frameworks are, fittingly, the frame.

Library 是砖块， Framework 就是框架
